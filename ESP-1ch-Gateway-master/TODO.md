# ToDo Functions

Features not in release 6.2.8
- Version for tx download
- Make better version for _ENCODE
- Repair _REPEATER to work for devices that are far away from the gateway
- Change Downstream timing to be more accurate (interrupt driven?).
- Frequency: Support for eu433 frequencies (Standard)
- Testing and timing of downlink functions (need quiet area)
- Get HOP frequency functions to work on two or three frequencies
- Security: Enable passwords for GUI access and WiFi upload (may not be necessary for normal home router use)
- Enable remote updating through GUI
- Support FSK (This may not be necessary)
- Support for other Class A and B, C of LoRa devices
